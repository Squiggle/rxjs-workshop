# RxJS Guide

Introduction to Reactive Extensions for JavaScript

## Prerequisites

This guide uses interactive JavaScript to demonstrate various concepts.

Prerequisites:
- npm

Recommended:
- Visual Studio Code
- Quokka.js VS Code plugin

## Guide

1. Open workspace in VSCode
1. In terminal, run `npm install`
1. Follow through the JavaScript files in numerical sequence
1. Later in the workshop you will be prompted to run various npm commands

> If using Quokka, you should see interactive feedback in each file. If you don't see this, use VS Code command 'Quokka: Start on current file' or keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+K, Q`.

## About

This guide expects the use of Quokka to visualise interactive JavaScript for the first few sections.

Later in the guide we provide interactive examples build with HTML.
The JavaScript examples and RxJS dependencies are bundled using rollup.
